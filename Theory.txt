JDBC : Java Database Connectivity

In JDBC we can create connection between java code and the Database
We make use of the driver class , URL , username , password to create a connection
Then to perform sql operations we can make use of Statements and PreparedStatements

Statements are used for static queries thus can be used only once .
PreparedStatements are used for dynamic queries thus can be used multiple times .

PreparedStatements are more preferred than Statements because of the reusability

Class.forName() checks if the class is present or not if present then returns an object of that class
else throws an ClassNotFound Exception
